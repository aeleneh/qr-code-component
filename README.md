## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For fonts



### What I learned

I learned that less is more, by mantaining good practice of naming my classes well and using the right css rule. The most challam=nging thing was using the right unit to measure dimensions

### Continued development

I plan on learning more about css, so as to build more responsive websites in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Google Ai Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) - This helped me in figuring out mistakes in my code especially the units for dimensions.
